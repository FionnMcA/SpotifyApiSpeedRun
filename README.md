# Wrappedify ðŸŽ‰

This website is currently in Developer mode. To use this website, your Spotify email must be pre-registered on my Spotify dashboard.

I will apply to Spotify to make this website publicly accessible once the access token process is finalized.

## How the Website Works for Users

**Note: While in Developer mode, I must have your email pre-registered on my Spotify dashboard.**

1. A user visits [wrappedify.com](https://wrappedify.com) and is directed to the landing page.
2. If they click "Login to Spotify," they are redirected to the Spotify authorization page.
3. After granting authorization, they are redirected to the Wrappedify results page.
4. On this page, users can view their Spotify Wrapped data for the last 4 weeks, 6 months, and year.
5. They can also create a playlist populated with the top tracks from each time period.

Example of a user's Wrapped up for the last 4 weeks. If they click "Create Playlist," a playlist will be created with their top 50 tracks of the last 4 weeks. 

Users can alternate between green, blue, red, and orange backgrounds, and view their Wrapped up for the last 4 weeks, 6 months, and year.
