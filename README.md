Just testing, deploying a website that integrates the spotify, api, 
The website returns a users top 5 artists and tracks of the last 4 weeks, 6 months and year
didn't fully implememt refresh token logic
But I'm now ready to build wraptify (or wrappedify, undecided)
Because my spotify app is on developer mode, only certain users can use it
